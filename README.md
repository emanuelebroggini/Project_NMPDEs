Poisson problem with heterogeneous diffusion.
Approximate the previous problem by means of the Finite Element method by considering different
FE spaces, mesh sizes, values of epsilon, N, and R. Solve the linear system corresponding to the FE
approximation with different preconditioners and test the scalability properties of the solver in the
the parallel setting.
